Track WoW Shadowlands prepatch Icecrown rare timers.

Open in browser [here](https://bloodleh.github.io/sl-ic-rares/).

### How to use?

* Click "Sync to EU" or "Sync to NA" to automatically populate the fields and sync the time to the latest rare in the region.
* Alternatively you can change the fields manually (like add 3-4 minutes to "Last killed at" so the timer tracks when the rare actually becomes active/killable).
* Set the "Show amount" field to manually decrease/increase the list size. Default 20 is a full one rare rotation.
* Check the "Audio beep" -checkbox to enable an audio notification when a rare is spawning.
* Click the copy icon next to the coords to copy "/way [coords] [rarename]" to the clipboard.
